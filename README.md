## Machine learning clustering Algoirthm 

# KMeans clustering Algoirthm
This notebook provides a complete implementation and tutorial of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch.  
[Open kmeans_tutorial.ipynb](kmeans_tutorial.ipynb)

What you'll learn:
How K-Means algorithm works step by step
Implementation from scratch in Python
Visualization of clustering results
How to use the algorithm for predictions

Perfect for Google Colab! Just run each cell sequentially.


# DBSCAN clustering Algorithm
This notebook introduces the DBSCAN clustering algorithm with an intuitive explanation and hands-on examples.  
[Open dbscan_tutorial.ipynb](dbscan_tutorial.ipynb)

What you'll learn:
- The core concepts behind DBSCAN (density-based clustering)
- How DBSCAN discovers clusters of arbitrary shape and detects noise/outliers
- Step-by-step Python implementation (with visualization)
- How to apply DBSCAN to your own datasets

Works great in Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks!
